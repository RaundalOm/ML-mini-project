# Movie Ratings Analysis

 Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing movie ratings, user demographics, and movie information. It performs descriptive, 
genre-based, demographic-based, and long-tail analyses. Additionally, visualizations are created to present insights from 
the data.

 Dataset Description
The project uses three datasets:

1. Ratings Dataset (`ratings.dat`):  
   Contains movie ratings given by users.  
   Format: `UserID::MovieID::Rating::Timestamp`.

2. Users Dataset (`users.dat`):  
   Includes demographic information about users.  
   Format: `UserID::Gender::Age::Occupation::Zip-code`.

3. Movies Dataset (`movies.dat`):  
   Provides movie details, including titles and genres.  
   Format: `MovieID::Title::Genres`.
